# Card Collection App

Hi there üñêÔ∏è this is my Passion Project assignment for HTTP 5226 during the Fall 2024 term

Throughout this semester I am going to be making updates and changes to the web app so please feel free to add comments or reach out.

This app is focused on the Trading Card Game Magic the Gathering, which features many cards from different sets and Artists.

Organizing one's collection has always been a challenge so I decided to create an app that would help me in that endeavor.

This app should be able to do the following:
1. Cards:
  -   See a list of cards currently in the DB
  -   Add Cards to the DB
  -   Edit Card Info
  -   Delete Cards
2. Artists: 
  -   See the Artists in the database
  -   Edit Artist Info
  -   Delete Artists
  -   See the cards each artist has drawn**
3. Colors:
  -  See the different colors
  -  See how many cards have each color
  -  See a list of cards that belongs to each color** <br>
**still need to be added in

Future Features:
To incorporate an api that searches through the DB of every MTG card and finds a random one to suggest for the collection
